# DESCRIPTION
#	This script generates a number of bash variables used in PCV and release build.
#
#	The main objective is to make it easy to rebuild in case of build error. Also build
#	parameters are explicit so that it is easy to understand or override. This script
#	generates a ./build.config file to be used by ./buildRelease, ./buildPcv and ./buildDev.
#	Run this script after ./setEnv.
#
# USAGE
#	See printUsage()
#
# NOTES
#	When bash script is run from Hudson, the output string of $(hostname), $(whoami) is return
#	with a trailing '\r'. Use tr to remove the trailing '\r' ($(hostname | tr -d -c [:print:])).
